## Structure Overview

The front-end of the app will be built with React and Javascript

The back-end will be built with Flask in python for simplified and quick development.

The app itself will be deployed with Vercel

The back-end will interact with a few systems for storing and managing user data, including:
an authentication system for managing user passwords and sessions, and a system for storing miscellaneous user data (name, calendar groups, etc.)
