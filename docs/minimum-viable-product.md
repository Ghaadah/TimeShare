## TimeShare Minimum Viable Product Goals
The minimum viable product for TimeShare is a webpage where users of the site can display a shared calendar between other users. The core features that will be needed for this from the "list of features" document are:

- Have users create accounts and grant access to their google calendars.

- Display the user's calendar along with the calendar of any connected users.

- Allow users to select which calendars they make public/share with specific calendar groups.

Each of these requirements will have at least a few user stories related to them.
